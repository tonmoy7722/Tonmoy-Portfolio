            <h1>Introduction</h1>
            <p>Hello! My name is Tonmoy, rhymes with cheddar, and I'm a <strong>photographer</strong> and <strong>front
                    end dev</strong> intern at <a href="http://dirigiblestudio.com/">Dirigible Studio</a> here in
                Madison, Wisco.
            </p>

            <p>I think it's important to help make the internet a <strong>beautiful place</strong>, whether that be
                through words, photography, or web design, and I'm excited to have found a community at <a
                    href="https://www.thinkful.com/">Thinkful</a> that shares my belief.</p>

            <p>I also think it's important to push yourself and <strong>learn</strong> one new thing every day, no
                matter what that may be. Did you know a duel between three people is called a <a

                    Wisconsin</a> my home, the land of dairy (Get outta here, California!). My favorite part about
                <b>Madison</b> is that we're a city built around a large <a href="http://www.wisc.edu/">university</a>.
                There's a vibrant crowd here that keeps this city bold and <strong>progressive</strong>.

                The isles of <a

            <p>You can find me in the city, <strong>camera</strong> in hand, documenting the stories around me, or in
                little cafe's writing about my daily <a href="http://www.kedarjoyner.com/blog/">adventures</a> and the
                people I meet.</p>

            <h1>More About Me</h1>
            <h2>What are your favorite hobbies?</h2>
            <p>I love to explore new cities, take photographs, eat tacos, catnap with my cat, bike to big lakes, hold
                hands, play video games, dance in hay lofts, spend weekends with my grandpa, drink good <a
                    href="http://www.proof66.com/whiskey/eagle-rare-10yr-bourbon.html">whiskey</a>, and sit outside all
                night on porches.</h2>

            <h2>What's your dream job?</h2>
            <p>A professional turtle racer. Just kidding, I would love to be a full-time <strong>creative</strong> who's
                given an array of responsibilities in front-end work, photography, design, and whatever else comes my
                way.</p>

            <h2>What music have you been listening to lately?</h2>
            <p>My husband and I recently roadtripped through Arizona listening to the band <a
                    href="http://houndmouth.com/">Houdmouth</a>. I don't know what it is about them, but they make you
                want to keep driving and driving. Start with the song <a
                    href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8wifV5RYr8">"Sedona"</a> first.</p>
